    %p
      There aren't many examples currently, but I implemented one app that allows you to add new comments on the page and delete them:
      <a href="https://github.com/snitko/nest_ui_example_app">https://github.com/snitko/nest_ui_example_app</a>

    %p Here's the full code of the example app.dart file from the link above:
    %pre
      %code.language-dart= partial "code_partials/examples_1_1.dart"


    %p If you'd like to add some more examples, please <a href="https://github.com/snitko/nest_ui_site">clone this site</a>, update this page and make a pull request.
