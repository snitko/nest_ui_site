      While technically it's a form field this class inherits directly from <span class="inlineCode">Component</span> and implements classic <span class="inlineCode">&lt;select&gt;</span> tag functionality.

    %p
      The decision to implement this component in NestUI instead of using native browser one was
      made to due to two factors:

      %ul
        %li
          Native <span class="inlineCode">&lt;select&gt;</span> is notoriously hard to style
        %li
          Some selects need additional functionality whic NestUI would allow to add by extending the <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponent</span> class.
    
    %p
      Basically, what this <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponent</span> does is it emulates
      native browser experience for <span class="inlineCode">&lt;select&gt;</span> tags including
      the following:

      %ul
        %li Opens/closes on Enter/Space
        %li Closes on Esc
        %li Closes when clicked outside of it
        %li Is navigatable with arrow keys, both when opened and closed
        %li Is searchable by typing in the first few characters
        %li Fetches options from a remote server

    %p
      To use this component, you'll first need to include it in your NestUI app
      manually. It was reasoned, that because this component is relatively big in size,
      we might just leave it out of default NestUI provided components. Here's how you plug it in:

    %pre
      %code.language-dart= partial "code_partials/components/select_1_1.dart"

    %p To use it, you'll need the following markup:

    %pre
      %code.block.language-markup= html_code_partial "components/select_1_2.html"

    %p
      If you want your select to have a default value when the page loads simply assign it
      using the input's value attribute, like this:

    %pre
      %code.block.language-markup= html_code_partial "components/select_1_3.html"


    %h4 input_value vs display_value
    %p
      There are two important properties of <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponent</span>:
      <span class="inlineCode">#input_value</span> determines what will be the value of the
      input field when it is sent to the server via a form submit, while <span class="inlineCode">#display_value</span>
      is what the user sees. For instance, while the user may select "Chile" in the list of countries,
      the <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponent#input_value</span> will be set to "123".

    %p
      There's a catch in how those are set upon page load. If for some reason, the <span class="inlineCode">#display_value</span> corresponding
      HTML element value is set, then the same value is assigned to <span class="inlineCode">#input_value</span>:

    %pre
      %code.language-dart= partial "code_partials/components/select_1_5.dart"

    %p
      This may look counter intuitive, but in reality you almost never want to set your <span class="inlineCode">#display_value</span> through DOM. What
      you really want to do is to set the <span class="inlineCode">#display_value</span> by reading an <span class="inlineCode">#input_value</span>
      from DOM, then assign <span class="inlineCode">#display_value</span> that corresponds to it:

    %pre
      %code.language-dart= partial "code_partials/components/select_1_6.dart"

    %p
      For this to work as described, you obviously need to have a list of options in the DOM
      (as in the example at the top of this page) that lists all options and their corresponding values.
      If there is a country "Chile" with value "123", then <span class="inlineCode">#display_value</span>
      will be assigned correctly.

    %h4 Disabling the component
    %p
      The <span class="inlineCode">#disabled</span> property if set to true makes the DOM element
      unresponsive to any user input and resets the <span class="inlineCode">#input_value</span> to null.
      This property may be set both through the setter and also in the HTML by adding the
      <span class="inlineCode">data-disabled="true"</span> to the dom element tied to the component.



    %h4 Fetching options from a remote server

    %p
      <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponent</span> has the ability to dynamically fetch options from a remote server. The url
      from wich to fetch those options is specified in the <span class="inlineCode">fetch_url</span> property. Additionally, a number of params
      may be passed after this url. The params are stored separately but are attached to the url when the request is made. This is done for
      convenience, so it's easier to update those params independently. For example suppose we want to make the following request to fetch
      the options for the <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponent</span>: <span class="inlineCode">/cities.json?country=Chile</span>.

    %p
      To do that, you'll need to first call the <span class="inlineCode">#updateFetchUrlParams()</span> method and pass it the Map of params
      you want to update (params not mentioned are not removed, if you want them removed, explicitly pass <span class="inlineCode">null</span>).
      Then call the <span class="inlineCode">#fetchOptions()</span> method, which will actually make a request and update the options in the component.

    %pre
      %code.language-dart= partial "code_partials/components/select_1_4.dart"

    %p
      It's important enough to note, that <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponentBehaviors</span> displays an ajax indicator
      while fetching options if an <span class="inlineCode">.ajaxIndicator</span> element exists inside your <span class="inlineCode">SelectComponent#dom_element</span>.
      The styling and positioning of the ajax indicator is, as always, entirely up to your css code.

    %h3 Behaviors
    %p For behaviors, you might want to look into the <a href="#{$nest_ui_docs}/nest_ui/SelectComponentBehaviors-class.html">documentation for the SelectComponentBehaviors class</a> which provides such important behaviors as <span class="inlineCode">.open()</span>, <span class="inlineCode">.close()</span>, <span class="inlineCode">.toggle()</span>, <span class="inlineCode">.enable()</span> and <span class="inlineCode">disable()</span>.
